        Consider the following when reviewing:

        ### If it's a documentation file (like README.md or requirements.txt):
        - Does it include all the essential sections? (e.g., project description, usage, install instructions)
        - Is it clearly written and informative?
        - Is anything important missing?

        ### If it's a utility/helper code file:
        - Are the functions clearly named and scoped?
        - Is the logic correct and well-documented?
        - Could the implementation be improved? (e.g., made cleaner, more efficient, or more Pythonic?)
        - Is the file doing too much or violating separation of concerns?

        ### General (applies to all code files):
        - Code cleanliness and structure
        - Comments and docstrings
        - Naming conventions
        - Maintainability and extensibility
        - Readability and formatting

        **Filename**: {file_path}
        
        **File Summary**:
        {file_summary}

        **File Content**:
        {file_content}

          "strengths": ["List of specific things done well"],
